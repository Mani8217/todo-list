## Attention:
- we only query for our submit button and input task field once in the beginning and store those two values in the variables submit and newTask.
- We can enable/disable a button by setting its disabled attribute to false/true.
- In JavaScript, we use .length to find the length of objects such as strings and arrays.
- At the end of the script, we add the line return false. This prevents the default submission of the form which involves either reloading the current page or redirecting to a new one.
- In JavaScript, we can create HTML elements using the createElement function. We can then add those elements to the DOM using the append function.
